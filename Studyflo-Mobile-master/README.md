# Studyflo-Mobile
Final project for COMP399 Mobile Application Development.

Our mobile app’s purpose is to help users to de-stress. Samantha and Arianna created a website in their Web Applications course last semester that they would like to turn into a mobile app with this project.
Their website was called “studyflo” and was created to help students to stay organized and mindful. With this application project we would like to take the ideas from this website and create a mobile app version. 
The website can be seen here: http://studyflo.herokuapp.com/
